A modified implementation of the pretty-printer from L.C. Paulson's
ML for the working programmer. The printer has been extended with three
different block types, each with a different behavior when it comes to breaking
lines. These block types correspond to three box types offered by the OCaml
Format library, which is used by the HOL light pretty-printer.

This code also includes an imperative wrapper around the (mostly-functional)
pretty printer core, which attempts to emulate the semantics of (parts of) the
Format library.
